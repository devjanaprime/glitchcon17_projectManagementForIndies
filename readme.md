![standups](images/standUps.png) 

Agile/Scrum syntax and methodologies for breaking a project into manageable portions:

- Epic: HIGH level objective. Large bucket into which at least one feature will live
- Story: (“user stories”) Often start with “I want…” and describe actions available for the user.
- Task: um… a task that needs to be completed
- Subtask: part of a larger task

Example 0:

- Epic: Player Locomotion 1.0
- Story: I want to double jump
- Tasks: capture jump button at right time, not allow jump after peak jump, 
- Related sub-tasks: input form, handshake with db
